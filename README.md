# Spruce

> Before you continue, please know that i am not well versed in writing parsers/languages. This is my first attempt at writing a parser. I am just a beginner. I am writing this parser for my own learning purposes. If you are looking for a production ready parser, this is not it.

Spruce is a simple html transpiler made for creating simple quick static websites.
The purpose of this project is to be able to make a templating language that is simple to use and understand while having features to easily create pages without having to change other files to make changes.
